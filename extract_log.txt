12. The viral protein SV40 is expressed in a cell derived from this organism in the workhorse strain 293T. Adherent cells derived from this organism are dissociated using Versene, a dilute stock of EDTA. At least a fifth of all cell banks worldwide were once contaminated by a strain from this species that has an approximately triploid chromosome count. Calcium phosphate transfects DNA into cells sourced from this organism like (*)​ HEK 293. At Johns Hopkins in 1951, George Gey isolated an immortalized cell line from this species, which was infected with papillomavirus, and therefore, could surpass this species' Hayflick limit of 60 doublings. For 10 points, HeLa cells are used for ​in vitro​ studies of what species which normally has 46 chromosomes?

Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline?! Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the neuromuscular junction—in other words, it is the chemical that motor neurons of the nervous system release in order to activate muscles. This property means that drugs that affect cholinergic systems can have very dangerous effects ranging from paralysis to convulsions.

With the , the militia was more organized and the name "National Guard" recommended. In 1908, the prohibition on National Guard units serving overseas was dropped. This resulted in constitutional debates within the U.S. government surrounding the legality of the use of the National Guard overseas, culminating in 1912 when U.S. Attorney General declared the 1908 amendment to be unconstitutional. The contained a provision whereby the president could discharge National Guard members from the militia and draft them into the Army in the event of a war, allowing for their use overseas. This resulted in former National Guard members being discharged from the Army entirely (also losing their status as state troops) when they left service, so the defined the National Guard's dual role as a state and federal reserve force; the "National Guard while in the service of could be ordered to active duty by the president, be deployed overseas if they so wished, and the Guardsmen would then revert to their status as state troops. The dual state and federal status proved confusing, so in 1933, the National Defense Act of 1916 was amended again. It finally severed the National Guard's traditional connection with the militia clause of the Constitution, providing for a new component called the "National Guard of the United States" that was to be a reserve component of the Army of the United States at all times.
